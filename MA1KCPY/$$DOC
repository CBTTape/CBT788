This application was previously available as the Category 4 MA1K
SupportPac and hosted on IBM's WebSphere MQ SupportPac website.  Changes
in IBM's licensing necessitated withdrawal of the code as a SupportPac.

The purpose of this application is to encapsulate triggered message
processing for MQSeries applications triggered in CICS TS.

Applications that are triggered can call this subroutine and receive
their triggering message. If the triggering message's
MQMD-BACKOUTCOUNT >= the queue's MQIA-BACKOUT-THRESHOLD the "poison"
message will be moved to the queue's MQCA-BACKOUT-REQ-Q-NAME. If the
queue has no MQCA-BACKOUT-REQ-Q-NAME the poison message will be
discarded.

In any case, a message will be written to the system log indicating
what action was taken.

POSSIBLE USES
This application generically encapsulates triggered message
processing, backout processing and error handling for triggered queues
in CICS TS. Adopted as a standard, or used as a base and modified to
create a standard, development time can be reduced and uniform error
handling assured.

CMQAPIDC  COBOL copybook used in several programs to provide
          identifiers to be used in CALL <identifier> statements.
          This allows dynamic invocation of the MQ API subroutines.

C7200506  COBOL copybook used by J7200506, renamed here with a C as the
          first character so it can reside in the same library as the
          source that refers to it.  J7200506 refers to this copybook
          by its original name - J7200506.

C7200507  COBOL copybook used by J7200507, renamed here with a C as the
          first character so it can reside in the same library as the
          source that refers to it.  J7200507 refers to this copybook
          by its original name - J7200507.

MQRSNCD1  COBOL copybook created by CMQV Rexx program included in
          this package.
